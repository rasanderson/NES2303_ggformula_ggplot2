# NES2303_ggformula_ggplot2

## Comparison of `ggformula` and `ggplot2`
As lots of students will be expected to use ggplot2 in other modules in Stage 2 and Stage 3, this shiny app gives a simple comparison

## To do or possible changes
* At the moment this is relatively simple: should more examples be given?
* There are many `ggplot2` extensions available <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/>. Would it be worth demonstrating one e.g. `patchwork` to allow multiple plots in one graph <https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork#patchwork> or `ggpubr` for publication-quality graphics <https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/>
